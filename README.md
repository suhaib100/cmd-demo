CRUD Demo Spring Boot Project
This repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) demo Spring Boot project. It showcases basic CRUD operations using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and an in-memory H2 database.

Overview
The CRUD Demo Spring Boot Project provides a foundation for building CRUD functionality in Spring Boot applications. It demonstrates how to set up RESTful endpoints for performing CRUD operations on a sample entity.

Features
Create, read, update, and delete operations for a sample entity.
RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the entity data.
Integration with Spring Data JPA for database operations.
Uses an in-memory H2 database for easy setup and testing.
Installation
To run the CRUD Demo Spring Boot Project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to start the application:
bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Access the application at http://localhost:8080.
Usage
Once the application is running, you can use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the CRUD endpoints. Here are some example API endpoints:

GET /api/entities: Retrieve all entities.

Example:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8080/api/entities
GET /api/entities/{id}: Retrieve a specific entity by ID.

Example:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8080/api/entities/1
POST /api/entities: Create a new entity.

Example:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"New Entity"}' http://localhost:8080/api/entities
PUT /api/entities/{id}: Update an existing entity.

Example:

bash
Copy code
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Updated Entity"}' http://localhost:8080/api/entities/1
DELETE /api/entities/{id}: Delete an entity by ID.

Example:

bash
Copy code
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/entities/1
Configuration
The project uses default configurations for Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. You can customize database settings, server port, etc., in the application.properties file.

Examples
Check out the src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/EntityController.java file for example implementations of CRUD endpoints.
